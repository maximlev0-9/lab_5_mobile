# lab_5

A new flutter app developed for mobile_flutter course.

This app allows you to get receipt for a random cocktail (mostly with some alcohol amount), using a
public API "CocktailDB". Also you can like any of those receipts and save them in your list of liked
cocktails.

In order to use my app please insert valid API key into variable "apikey" in lib/service/http_service.dart

Please, don't make too much requests or my account will be blocked :(

Here are the screenshots of this app:
